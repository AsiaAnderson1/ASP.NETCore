Here I've bult a multi-page data-driven application using a MVC format.
This application should display a list of contacts and a link to add a contact.
When the user clicks the first/last name, the app will display the detail of the contact.
The Details page includes buttons that allow a user to edit or delete a contact.
A app displays the delete page to confirm the deletion.
The app is coded to display a summary of validation if a user enters invalid data.
User input is stored into a database generated through NuGet packages.
I use EF code first to create a database based on my domain model classes.
I seed initial data into the database for my categories and contacts so that it will display on the first page.
In this application I modify, the Startup file to modify the HTTP request and response pipeline to provide user-friendly URLS using a slug.
I code primary keys by convention so that they are automatically generated.
I've also used Razor layouts. I've used Bootstrap to style the views and some custom css.
