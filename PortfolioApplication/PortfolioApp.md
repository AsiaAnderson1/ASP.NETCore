This is a generic portfolio website. This application has been coded using the MVC format.
I utilize strongly typed razor views for a web page.
Then I develop Razor layouts that provide elements that can be shared for multiple pages.
I use tag helpers to map to the action methods of my controllers.
I bind Html elements to properties of my views' models.
I've nested a razor layout in the help area that uses a mainh layout. My view start file applies this nested layout to the views in the help area.
I've coded a bootstrap navbar that will mark which link is active.
