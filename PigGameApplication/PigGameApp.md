This application was built using the MVC format.
It's a simple game of pig where each player takes a turn rolling a die for points.
First Player to 20 wins.
Turn ends when player rolls a 1 or chooses to hold.
If a player rolls 2, they lose all points earned during their turn.
If a player holds, points earned during their turn are added to their total.
The objective of this project was to build a single-page app that uses session state to persist data between requests.
This application was model heavy where I used the objects to pass information between each other.
This application had to generate a random number between 1 and 6 when a player clicks roll.
